-what is software testing?
Software testing is the process of evaluating that the software is working properly and as expected. we as a qa tester, make sure that we reduce bugs,failures in production so that the final and quality product reaches to the end users.

-Why companies hire Qa engineers?
Because qa engineers make sures the final software has the user uses is of high quality , bug free, less failure in production , which means company resources can be saved.

-What is agile methodology?
Agile is a flexible, iterative, and collaborative approach to software development that breaks projects into small, manageable cycles called "sprints" (usually 1-4 weeks). Instead of planning everything upfront and delivering once at the end, Agile delivers working software in small increments, continuously adapting based on feedback


Scrum is an Agile framework that organizes work into fixed time periods called sprints, typically 2 weeks long. There are three roles: the Product Owner who prioritizes work, the Scrum Master who facilitates the process, and the Development Team who builds the product.​

The team uses three artifacts: the Product Backlog containing all work, the Sprint Backlog for current sprint work, and the Increment which is the working product at sprint end.​

Each sprint includes five ceremonies: Sprint Planning to select work, Daily Standups for coordination, Sprint Review to demonstrate completed work, Sprint Retrospective for process improvement, and Backlog Refinement to prepare future work.​

As a QA tester, I would participate in all ceremonies, test features throughout the sprint—not just at the end—collaborate closely with developers, and help ensure each increment meets our Definition of Done before it's considered complete.

Your Role as a QA Tester in Scrum
During Sprint Planning:
Review user stories and acceptance criteria​

Ask clarifying questions about requirements

Identify testability concerns early

Estimate testing effort for each item

Plan which test cases you'll write

During the Sprint:
Write detailed test cases for selected features​

Test features as soon as developers complete them (not at the end!)​

Log defects immediately in the tracking system

Attend Daily Standups and share testing progress​

Collaborate with developers to clarify requirements

Retest fixed bugs quickly

Update task status on Sprint Backlog board

During Sprint Review:
Help demonstrate tested features​

Explain testing coverage and quality metrics

Report on bugs found and fixed

During Sprint Retrospective:
Share testing challenges​

Suggest process improvements

Discuss quality issues and prevention strategies

How does QA participate in SDLC phases?"

"QA should be involved from the very beginning of the SDLC, not just during the testing phase. In the Planning phase, we validate requirements for testability and create test strategies. During Design, we review architecture and UI designs to catch issues early. In Development, we write test cases, prepare test environments, and perform early component testing. The formal Testing phase is where we execute comprehensive functional and non-functional testing, log defects, and verify fixes. During Deployment, we perform smoke testing and production validation. Finally, in Maintenance, we test patches and updates with thorough regression testing.​

The key principle is 'shift-left testing'—involving QA early reduces costs and catches defects before they become expensive to fix. Each SDLC phase corresponds to specific STLC activities, ensuring quality is built in throughout the entire development process, not just checked at the end."​

2.4 Agile & Scrum Basics (Afternoon – 3h Theory + Light Practice)

Why Agile?
Companies in Australia heavily use Agile/Scrum and often mention it in QA roles.

Analogy:
Instead of building an entire car and then checking if the customer likes it, Agile builds in small usable chunks:

Sprint 1: Steering + wheels

Sprint 2: Engine

Sprint 3: Interior

Each sprint: build, test, get feedback, improve.

Scrum Roles:

Product Owner (PO): decides what to build (backlog, priorities)

Scrum Master: ensures process runs smoothly (removes blockers)

Development Team: devs, testers, designers – everyone building the product

Scrum Ceremonies:

Sprint Planning: decide what to build this sprint

Daily Stand-up: 15-min daily sync – what you did, doing, blockers

Sprint Review: demo to stakeholders

Sprint Retrospective: what went well / what to improve

Scrum Artifacts:

Product Backlog: full to-do list of features

Sprint Backlog: tasks picked for current sprint

Increment: working software at end of sprint

QA’s Role in Scrum:

Join planning to estimate testing effort and suggest test ideas.

In daily stand-ups, say:

“Yesterday I tested the login feature and reported 2 bugs. Today I will retest the fixes and start signup test cases. No blockers.”

Help refine acceptance criteria.

Perform continuous testing during the sprint instead of waiting at the end.
